**Mainnet.** This will download the entirety of the Bitcoin blockchain. That's 280G of data (and getting more every day).

**Pruned Mainnet.** This will cut the blockchain you're storing down to just the last 550 blocks. If you're not mining or running some other Bitcoin service, this should be plenty for validation.

**Testnet.** This gives you access to an alternative Bitcoin blockchain where the Bitcoins don't actually have value. It's intended for experimentation and testing.

**Pruned Testnet.** This is just the last 550 blocks of Testnet ... because the Testnet blockchain is pretty big now too.

**Private Regtest.** This is Regression Testing Mode, which lets you run a totally local Bitcoin server. It allows for even more in-depth testing. There's no pruning needed here, because you'll be starting from scratch. This is a very different setup
